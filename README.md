**Description**

YES WE CAN is a project that takes advantage of virtual reality technology to provide people without disabilities an experience of living the daily life of a disabled person, since it is essential to raise awareness of obstacles and barriers people with disabilities are facing.

The project is aimed at students and visitors of events at St. PÃ¶lten UAS, such as Open Day, Researchers' Night, etc, since it intends to simulate the university environments such as the entrance, classrooms, media rooms and affiliated sport spaces.

The application consists of two elements: a video interview and an interactive environment based on the St. PÃ¶lten UAS.

For the video interview, we tell the story of 3 characters with disabilities (specifically visual, mobility and learning disabilities). This section intends to inform users about each disability by describing what it is, the obstacles and challenges that come with it as well as behaviors that are harmful and how to correct them and be more considerate. The characters and interview will be fictional, but based on real-life research, people and interviews conducted by our team.

For the interactive environment, we simulate some areas of the St. PÃ¶lten UAS building, as mentioned previously, particularly the entrance and some of the classrooms. The user will take on the role of one of the disabled characters with the goal of performing some daily tasks. They will be asked to navigate the university entrance while facing some of the obstacles exposed previously, as well as learning about special accessibility features in the building. Afterwards, they will be placed in a classroom (e.g. art class, music class, sport class) and will be able to perform various leisure activities.

The purpose of the two environments is to show, in the first place, the daily struggles of this group of people, but also show that they are human beings who can enjoy the same hobbies, albeit with some adaptations.
